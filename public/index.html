                      <p>Dear Courtney,</p>

                      <p>
                        I recently received an inspiring note from a medical professional who flew Delta to perform three lifesaving surgeries on 
                        children. It was a reminder that travel continues to be essential for many who are on the front lines responding to this pandemic, 
                        and why, if you must fly, our work to transport you safely is more important than ever.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        For those of you who cannot travel right now, our mission is to serve you by helping with the crisis response. In addition to flying
                        medical volunteers free of charge to some of the hardest-hit areas in the U.S., Delta has joined brands across the globe in partnering
                        with health and community organizations. That includes our cargo division transporting critical supplies where they are most needed, like
                        the 500,000 surgical masks delivered to Michigan last weekend for nurses and doctors on the front lines. With changes to onboard and Delta 
                        Sky Club® offerings, we donated 200,000 pounds of food to hospitals, food banks and other community groups, while face shields manufactured
                        by Delta Flight Products are being used by hospital workers in New York and Atlanta.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        Through it all, I am humbled by the ways you continue to heal our communities and embody the hope we need today. When you must travel:
                      </p>

                      <ul>
                        <li>
                          Your safety remains paramount. Following the CDC’s recommendation, we’re providing face masks to employees,
                          and I encourage you to bring a face mask for your own protection. And new initiatives will make space for 
                          safer travel through June 30 by blocking middle seats, limiting the number of people on each flight, boarding 
                          by rows from back to front, and pausing automatic advanced Medallion® Complimentary Upgrades to process them at the gate.
                        </li>

                        <li>
                          Flexibility is important in uncertain times. Since the last update, change fee waivers have been extended to allow travel 
                          through Sept. 30, 2022, for customers who have upcoming travel booked as of today through Sept. 30, 2020, or have canceled 
                          travel from flights in March through Sept. 30, 2020.
                        </li>
                      </ul>

                      <p>
                        We remain committed to taking care of the Delta people who take care of you, and are thankful to members of Congress, 
                        the President and the Administration for recognizing the importance of our people and industry via the CARES Act payroll 
                        protection. This bipartisan support will help ensure that air travel plays a leading role in the recovery once the pandemic 
                        is contained, and that our people will be positioned to serve you when you’re ready to resume flying.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        As everyone adapts to this new normal, many of you are posting on social media reminiscing about your favorite 
                        destinations and where you hope to travel with us next. Thank you for those shared moments. We can’t wait for 
                        the day when we’re taking you on your next adventure and appreciate your support.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        Sincerely,
                      </p>
