                        I recently received an inspiring note from a medical professional who flew Delta to perform three lifesaving surgeries on 
                        children. It was a reminder that travel continues to be essential for many who are on the front lines responding to this pandemic, 
                        and why, if you must fly, our work to transport you safely is more important than ever.
                      </p>
